\begin{abstract}
This article summarizes the description and evaluation of a new device
interface that reduce, if not remove, the need for indirection in flash-based
SSD storage: It has been presented by Yiyang Zhang et al. a paper called
\textit{De-Indirection for Flash-Based SSDs with Nameless Writes"}.

Their idea is to let the device choose the most suitable block in which to
write the data. The address of the write is then provided to the client (file
system). By doing so, the device is able to execute critical tasks such as
garbage collection and wear leveling without relying on the file system.

We quickly present SSDs and the notion and indirection. We then introduce
the Nameless Writes interface and some of the evaluations done by the authors
of the original paper on an emulated nameless-writing device.

This summary is in no way intended to cover the summarized paper in full.
Readers interested in the details must refer to the original paper.

\section*{Introduction}
Indirection is used in many computer systems. It is used mainly to improve
their performance and reliability. For example current hard drives make use of
a mapping table that remaps faulty sectors to other locations transparently
(from the file system's point of view).

Solid State Drives (SSDs) also use indirection in order to satisfy the
specific requirements of their hardware (wear leveling, erase / program
cycle, garbage collection). In particular, when a file is modified on an SSD,
its original location cannot be updated. The hardware uses copy on write and
must make use of indirection to make the filesystem believe that the updated
data still resides at the same (virtual) address. The problem is that storing
a table to map physical to virtual addresses wastes a lot of expensive flash
memory.

In this article, we summarize a paper called \textit{De-Indirection for
	Flash-Based SSDs with Nameless Writes}, in which Yiyang Zhang et al.
propose a way to modify to current SSDs and file systems to remove the need
for indirection. Their idea is to let the SSD choose the name (address) of the
data to be written and only after inform the file system for it to register
the location in its internal data structures.

Content of the report. In the first section we introduce SSDs and their
particular functionning mode. We then present the techniques of indirection
that are currently used in SSDs to ensure wear-leveling in the second section.
In the third section, Nameless Writes are introduced together with their
device interface. The problem of recursive writes is also addressed.
Finally, we present some evaluation in the fourth section and show that
nameless writes could be a viable solution to solve the indirection issues
in SSDs.

\section*{Indirection in SSDs}
As discussed in the previous section, indirection plays a crucial role in
SSDs to increase their lifetime. Indirection is implemented in the Flash
Translation Layer (FTL), which maps the virtual to the physical address space. 

The main problem with the indirection found in FTLs is that it comes with
performance and space overheads.

To better understand the problem, let's consider that we have a 1TB SSD split
up into 2KB pages. A full page mapping (with one 32-bit pointer per page)
would require a 2GB space, which would be unacceptable considering the cost
of SRAM.

An other idea is to map blocks of, say 128 pages. The space cost of the
mapping would be reduced to 32MB which seems more reasonable. However, it has
been shown that with such coarse grain mapping, there is a huge performance
overhead introduced by garbage collection (Gupta et al.).

A majority of the SSDs that are available to buy use both of these schemes.
Most of the data is mapped at block level, but there is a small area that is
mapped at the page level for more efficient updates. This technique keeps
the space overhead reasonably low while avoiding the high garbage collection
cost of the full block-level mapping. The main problem with this technique is
that the FTL is made very complex, and there is still a performance overhead
(and it is also harder to maintain). Moreover, garbage collection can still be
costly and induce a performance problem.

In all of these designs, the indirection in the FTL implies some cost that
might not be very significant now, but that will become a problem when the
SSDs scale. The hybrid schemes will eventually become infeasible.

To solve these problems, the authors of the paper introduce Nameless Writes.

\section*{Nameless Writes}
The aim of the new technique presented here is to reduce most of the costs of
indirection while keeping its benefits. The idea is not to provide any address
for a write operation. The device can itself choose where to put the data
among all physical pages. The file system is then notified and can record the
data in its data-structures.

Here is the main interface of a nameless writing device:
\begin{lstlisting}
Nameless_Write(data, len, meta): status, phys@
Nameless_Overwrite(phys@, data, len, meta): status, new@
Physical_Read(phys@, len, meta): status, data
Free(virt/phys@, len, meta, flag): status
\end{lstlisting}
Note that the nameless overwrite has the same mechanism. The original address
is given as a parameter, and the new address is returned once the device has
made its choice. Also, since a nameless write is an allocating operation,
there is a corresponding free operation. In case of a nameless overwrite, the
free is handled by the device. Note that for the read operation the physical
address is to be provided.

There is but one problem with this Nameless Write interface: the recursive
update problem. If the only available write operation is nameless write, any
update to the file system will require a recursive set of updates up the file
system tree. For exemple, appending a block at the end of a file will require
the inode of the file to be modified using a nameless overwrite which will
change its location. So any structure referencing the inode will have to be
modified, propagating potentially the update up to the file system root.

To solve this problem, the authors of the paper propose to provide a segmented
address space: a large physical address space for nameless writes, and a small
virtual address space mapped to the physical address space. Keeping the
pointer-based structures in the virtual space will break the recursion in case
of reccursive update.

The operations provided for virtual read and write are usual:
\begin{lstlisting}
Virtual_Read(virt@, len): status, data
Virtual_Write(virt@, data, len): status
\end{lstlisting}

Only a very small indirection table is kept by the device to map the virtual
addresses to physical addresses, and it will usually fit in the device cache.
The size of the segement is not fixed, so that it can be addapted to the file
system in use.

Note that physical writes are not allowed, only the device has the power to
choose the location of a write. Also, to distinguish a block that is mapped by
a virtual block, a flag is set in its metadata which are included in the block
headers.

The device also needs to be able to move data from one place to another in
order to allow wear leveling. The interface defines a callback function that
can notify the file system of data migration.
\begin{lstlisting}
Migration [Callback] (old_phys@, new@, meta)
\end{lstlisting}

Blocks in the virtual address space can be moved without having to notice the
file system, but for the blocks that are in the physical space, the migration
callback have to be used for the file system to update its data structures
accordingly.

\section*{Conclusion}
Nameless Writes have been introduced to reduce the cost of indirection in
SSDs. This new interface still ensures wear-leveling and has been tested using
and emulated device for which Yiyang Zhang ported the Linux ext3 file system.

Nameless-writing devices have great advantages, as have been shows with the
results of the evaluation. In particular, the space cost of the system is
greatly reduced even compared to hybrid mapping FTLs, and random-write
performance are improved. The design of the FTL is also made much simpler.

Even though the authors only ported the Linux ext3 file system to work with
their emulated nameless-writing device, they argue that it would be possible
(and will be future work) to do the same with other file systems (ext2,
copy-on-write file systems, extent-based file systems).
